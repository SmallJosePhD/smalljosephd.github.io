abstract: 'Over the past three decades, Nigeria has experienced unstable domestic investment and direct foreign investment inflows, and the country continues to face rising corruption and related problems. An ARDL technique has been adopted to explore long-term FDI impact on domestic investment including evaluating if FDI-domestic investment nexus is dependent on corruption level in Nigeria over this period. The bounds test result shows an evidence of a long-term relation amongst FDI, domestic investment and corruption (including GDP per capita, lending rate, exchange rate and oil price). We find that increasing inward FDI reduces (crowds-out) domestic investment and greater corruption control (lowering corruption level) leads to higher domestic investment in Nigeria over the long-term. Also, the influence of FDI on domestic investment depends on (or varies with) corruption level. FDI crowds-in domestic investment at greater corruption control than at lesser corruption control in the long-term. Other significant long-term influencers of domestic investment are exchange rate and oil price. Given these outcomes, we offer some recommendations to boost domestic investment in Nigeria.'
