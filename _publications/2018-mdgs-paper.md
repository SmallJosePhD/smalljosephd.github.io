abstract: 'Though poverty is multi-facet, a program designed to alleviate poverty by way of providing food for the citizens to eat, access to education, adequate shelter, health, and protection from violence etc. is obviously an action of change. An example of such program is the MDGs which strive to halve poverty and hunger before the end of 2015. With the startling increase in poverty in Nigeria, even with the locally designed policies and programs to compliment the achievement of the MDGs, a need to assess the influence of the program on poverty eradication is therefore necessary. As such this study utilized the OLS technique to analyze the MDGs indices within 2000 – 2015, and incorporating the ODA received, government expenditure, population with access to clean water, agricultural growth and economic growth. The results therefore demonstrate that ODA, government expenditure, growth of the economy, and access to clean water poses significant negative effect on poverty and hunger in the country. However, adoption of the SDGs, measure to curb funds mismanagement, ODA inflow enhancement and plans that will boost the growth of the economy are recommended.'
